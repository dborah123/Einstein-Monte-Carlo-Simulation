# Einstein-Solid-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
A demo of a project I worked on simulating an Einstein solid using numpy and pandas in Python

I used OOP to design an Einstein Solid object that has functions that allow it to perform Monte Carlo Simulations. It displays the probability distribution of the number of quanta in each box. Alongside this, I also display the analytical solution as seen in the lines on the graph. Through this project, I gained experience using matplotlib and pandas as well as learned a new statistical method.
